        <p class="text">I am studying at the best school in my city.  I feel happy to be a part of this great school with the good friends,
             helpful and loving teacher and sound school administration.
             I have extraordinary skills in some subjects whereas I am very weak in the few.</p>

    <figcaption><strong>MY STRENGTH</strong></figcaption>
    <p class="text">In compare to studies, I am good at sports. 
        so I am the captain of my class basketball team. 
        I am the best football player at my school. 
        Besides this, I am a fast runner also and I love athletics.

        The advice of my parents had a keen effect on my habits.
         I believe to speak the truth and try my best not to lie. My parents always advised me that if I commit a mistake, I should admit it.
          I try my best to do so. I know how to remain happy in every condition.
           Because I believe that: “Happiness is not out there; it’s in you.”
        
        I am a very adventurous person too and like to take the risk.
         I like to do a creative thing besides doing old stuff again and again.
          Learning new things is one thing which I always enjoy. I always update myself with the news.
        
        Along with this, I fond of reading a few children magazines in which different motivational stories are there.
         They taught me a high moral lesson. I am a very confident person and know how to talk.
          I always try to speak to every person according to his requirement so I understand people.</p>

    <figcaption><strong>MY WEAKNESS</strong></figcaption>
    <p class="text">As every man have weaknesses, so have also. I am a little bit lazy at some places which I do not like. While playing time, 
        I pass my lot of time there which is not a good habit, but I try my best to overcome my weaknesses.</p>

    <figcaption><strong>MY AMBITION</strong></figcaption>
    <p class="text">Everybody has an ambition in life. Aim or ambition is the inner aspiration of man.
         No man can do anything in the world without aim. So, all of us should be very determined about our aim in life.

        Without good career planning, right from the start, one can’t be on the right track.
         One has to set the goals in accordance with his or her broad career goals.</p>
